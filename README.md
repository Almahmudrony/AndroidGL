Android demos for OpenGL with Java and C++ (NDK) 

##OpenGLJava 
Repository includes an OpenGL app that loads a model in json format and renders it. It can deal with textures, and shaders in separate files (located in assets folder).

To create models in the required format  a [tool](https://github.com/lighthouse3d/Demos-and-Tools/tree/master/Assimp2JSON) is provided that reads models with [Assimp](http://www.assimp.org/) and writes the respective json file.
